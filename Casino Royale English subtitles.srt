1
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:14,169
M really doesn't mind you make a little extra money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,203
She just prefer if it wasn't sense secrets.

3
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:31,201
If this theatric is supposed to scare me, you have the wrong man, Bond.

4
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:35,206
If M was so sure I was bent, -

5
00:01:35,206 --> 00:01:37,856
-she would have sent an 00.

6
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:43,206
As being section chief, I'd known if anyone had been permitted 00 status.

7
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:49,466
- Your file's showing no kills, but it takes ... - Two.

8
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:10,422
Shame. We barely got to know each other.

9
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:17,198
I know where you keep your gun.

10
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:20,202
So I've learned something.

11
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,610
True.

12
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:28,181
- How did he die? - Your contact? Not well.

13
00:03:12,196 --> 00:03:14,189
Made you feel it, did it?

14
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,190
Well, you needn't worry, the second ...

15
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:30,846
Yes. Considerably.

16
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:17,014
007 STATUS CONFIRMED

17
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,317
So, how do I trust this man that I've never met with my money?

18
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:26,161
They ask for the introduction. That's all my organisation will garuantee.

19
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,297
I suppose our friend, Mr White.. that I've provided the bank services -

20
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:13,443
- for many other freedom fighters over the years.

21
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:22,414
- Do you believe in God, Mr. Le Chiffre? - No.

22
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:25,205
I believe in a reasonable rate of eternety.

23
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:28,654
- I want no risk on the portefolio. - Agreed.

24
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:32,032
- And I can access it anywhere in the world? - Yes.

25
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,938
I have the money, so sell my Skyfleet stock.

26
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,257
Sir, you must know you're betting against the market.

27
00:08:58,297 --> 00:09:01,978
Noone expect these shares to go anywhere else but up.

28
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,001
Just do it.

29
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,302
Looks like our man. Burnt scare on his fist.

30
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:46,034
I wonder if bomb makers are insured against this.

31
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,125
He is on the move.

32
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:04,309
He's heading straight on me.

33
00:10:05,462 --> 00:10:08,375
- Stop touching your ear.  - Sorry?

34
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:09,872
Put your hand down!

35
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,630
Toss that bloody weapon, I need him alive.

36
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,795
Listen to me.

37
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,613
Wheeping blood comes from a disarrangement of the lachrymal duct.

38
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:39,910
Nothing seriously.

39
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:52,825
I have two pairs, and you have a 17,4 % schance of making a Straight.

40
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:19,070
BRITISH GOVERNMENT AGENT KILLS UNARMED PRISONER

41
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,599
When does Ellipsis expire?

42
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:24,046
We have less than 36 hours ...

43
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:28,628
No, no, that's all the time I have in, mate.

44
00:20:29,265 --> 00:20:31,743
Let our guests have 5 minutes to leave.

45
00:20:31,783 --> 00:20:34,049
Or throw them overboard.

46
00:20:45,052 --> 00:20:47,004
Who the hell do they think that they are?

47
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:51,009
Even the Prime Minister is smart enought to not ask questions about what we do.

48
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,933
Have you ever seed such a buch of self rightous ass covering frings?

49
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:57,866
They don't care what we do, they only care about what we get photographed doing.

50
00:20:57,897 --> 00:21:00,435
And how the hell could Bond be so studpid?

51
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:04,521
I give him 00 status and he celebrates by shooting up an embassy.

52
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:06,079
And where the hell is he?

53
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:10,387
In the old days, when they did something that embarassing,they had the good sense to defect.

54
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:12,046
Christ, I miss the cold war.

55
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:29,962
- You got a bloody cheek. - Sorry.

56
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:33,724
- I'll shoot the camera next time. - Or yourself.

57
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:35,787
Yoy stormed into an embassy.

58
00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:40,166
You violated the only absolute rule in international relationships.

59
00:22:40,187 --> 00:22:42,462
And why? So you could kill a nobody.

60
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,991
We wanted to question him, not to kill him.

61
00:22:45,021 --> 00:22:48,035
For God's sake, you're supposed to display a sense of judgement.

62
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:50,189
I did.

63
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,031
I thought to extinct a bombmaker would be a good thing.

64
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:54,993
One bombmaker.

65
00:22:55,034 --> 00:22:58,027
We're trying to find out how an entire group of terrorists are financed, -

66
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:01,031
- and you give us one bombmaker.

67
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:04,025
The man isn't even a true believer.

68
00:23:04,055 --> 00:23:05,855
He is a gun for hire.

69
00:23:05,896 --> 00:23:10,831
And thanks to your over developed trigger finger we have no idea of who hired him or why.

70
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:15,028
- And where the hell did you find out where I lived? - Same way I found out your name.

71
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:21,026
- I had no idea what M stood for ... - Utter one more sylabelle and I'll have you killed.

72
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,021
I knew it was too early to promote you.

73
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:28,024
And I understand 00's have a very short life expectancy

74
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:32,019
So your mistake will be very short lived.

75
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:41,981
Bond, this is maybe too much for a blunt instrument to understand.

76
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:46,027
- but arrogance and self awareness seldom go hand in hand.

77
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,889
So you want me to be half munk and half hitman?

78
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,025
Any munk can kill. I want you to take your ego out of the equation.

79
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,979
And to judge the situation dispassionately.

80
00:23:56,747 --> 00:24:01,086
I have to know if I can trust you.. and to know that you know who to trust.

81
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:04,616
Since I don't know that, I need you out of my sight.

82
00:24:04,646 --> 00:24:08,024
Stick your head in the sand and think about your future.

83
00:24:08,044 --> 00:24:11,028
Because these bastards want your head, -

84
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:15,013
- and I am seriously considering feeding you to them.

85
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,064
And Bond ...

86
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,021
Don't ever break into my house again.

87
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:46,006
Good day sir,  welcome to the Ocean Club.

88
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:09,004
Hello? Are you going to take this, or make me wait?

89
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,998
Sorry sir, sorry sir.

90
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:37,038
Welcome to the Ocean Club sir, checking in?

91
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:37,949
Yes.

92
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:41,064
It's a last moment, but do you have a room?

93
00:28:42,985 --> 00:28:46,535
- We have an ocean view villa. - Perfect.

94
00:28:49,913 --> 00:28:56,396
Could you do me a favour, I was at a dinner last night, and I parked my car next to a beautiful 1964 Aston Martin....

95
00:28:56,426 --> 00:28:58,479
- and I'am ashamed to say that I nicked the door and..

96
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,664
Mr. Dimitrios.

97
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:06,550
If it isn't noticed, I'm not sure I would mention it.

98
00:29:06,591 --> 00:29:10,454
But if I felt contempt to find him..

99
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,699
He has a house just up the beach.

100
00:29:14,216 --> 00:29:15,794
Thank you.

101
00:30:14,777 --> 00:30:17,498
- What? - He is in the Bahamas.

102
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:19,976
You want to share his holiday plans?

103
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:23,970
He is logged into our secure web site using your name and password.

104
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:26,479
How the hell does he know these things?

105
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:29,907
I'll do my best to find out.

106
00:30:29,948 --> 00:30:33,882
- Who's he looking at? - Alex Dimitrios.

107
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,965
That slimy bugger.

108
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,960
No known associates.

109
00:30:59,095 --> 00:31:00,400
Le Chiffre.

110
00:31:15,965 --> 00:31:18,959
Have a good night club, gentlemen.

111
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:23,732
- What shall I serve? - Good evening. A vodka martini.

112
00:31:24,956 --> 00:31:26,959
Sharp, big boy.

113
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:38,751
- Mind if I join you? - Good evening.

114
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:52,951
- Small blind. Big blind. - I'm in.

115
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:58,958
That's to you.

116
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:03,600
If that's for luck, you're twelve late.

117
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:14,543
- Left to you? - I heard you.

118
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,175
- Check or bet. - Check.

119
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,583
- And you? - 5000.

120
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,954
Five to call.

121
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:49,709
- Check. - Check to you, sir.

122
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:52,581
All in.

123
00:32:52,611 --> 00:32:54,907
No, wait.

124
00:32:54,938 --> 00:32:58,943
- 20.000. - Table sticks, I'm sorry sir.

125
00:33:02,432 --> 00:33:06,760
This is on the table. that's my car. You'll bet?

126
00:33:06,801 --> 00:33:08,915
Sorry, mr. Dimitrios.

127
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:12,596
Please, give him the chance to win his money back.

128
00:33:21,719 --> 00:33:23,944
All right, show me, gentlemen.

129
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:30,437
Three kings.

130
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:40,227
Triple aces. Aces win.

131
00:33:44,748 --> 00:33:46,750
Oh, and the valet ticket.

132
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:51,938
Thank you.

133
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:26,932
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

134
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:30,937
No wonder he was such a phoney.

135
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:34,932
- My mistake. - Can I give you a lift home?

136
00:34:34,962 --> 00:34:37,935
Oh that would really send him over the hills.

137
00:34:38,937 --> 00:34:42,932
- I'm afraid I'm not that cruel. - Or you're just out of practice.

138
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:53,935
- Perhaps. - What about a drink at my place?

139
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,930
Your place? Is it close?

140
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:00,934
Very.

141
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,650
One drink.

142
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:35,735
- Good evening sir, and welcome back. - Welcome to my home.

143
00:35:47,922 --> 00:35:53,384
I have a hard time seeing this is my fault. It's your plan, all I did was get you the man.

144
00:35:53,414 --> 00:35:57,409
A man under surveillance by the British Secret Service.

145
00:35:59,604 --> 00:36:04,923
- Which makes me wonder if I can trust you at all. - So don't, I couldn't care less.

146
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,634
But I do care about my reputation.

147
00:36:07,674 --> 00:36:09,920
I have someone else for you to do the job.

148
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,923
He just needs the particulars. And payment.

149
00:36:23,836 --> 00:36:27,720
You like married women, don't you James?

150
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:30,632
That keeps it simple.

151
00:36:33,636 --> 00:36:36,468
What is it about bad men?

152
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:39,492
You.. my husband..

153
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:42,101
I have so many chances to be happy -

154
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:44,802
- so many nice guys.

155
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:48,089
Why can't nice guys be more like you?

156
00:36:48,129 --> 00:36:50,799
They would be bad.

157
00:36:55,502 --> 00:36:58,718
But so much more interresting.

158
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:05,049
What makes your husband a bad man?

159
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,831
His nature, I suppose.

160
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:13,747
- The nature of his work? - A mystery I'm afraid.

161
00:37:13,788 --> 00:37:19,158
I'm also afraid you sleep with me in order to get to him.

162
00:37:19,188 --> 00:37:23,911
- Are you afraid? - Not enough to stop.

163
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:35,724
Can I ask you a personal question?

164
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:39,325
No, won't seem like the properiate time.

165
00:37:39,355 --> 00:37:41,479
Does Ellipsis mean anything to you?

166
00:37:50,844 --> 00:37:56,204
- Should I ask him about it? - Perhaps later.

167
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:57,984
Yes, dear?

168
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:06,237
Ok, I understand. See you tomorrow, bye bye.

169
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:13,297
Apparently, he's on the last flight to Miami.

170
00:38:13,337 --> 00:38:16,877
So you have all night to question me.

171
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:24,209
In that case we'll need more champagne.

172
00:38:30,904 --> 00:38:33,605
- Good evening, room service. - Good evening.

173
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:36,366
Can I have a bottle of Bollinger, La Grand Annee -

174
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:39,572
- And Beluga caviar? - Yes, with everything.

175
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:42,141
- Would that be for two, sir? - What?

176
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:44,922
- No, for one.

177
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:19,774
Wait here.

178
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:33,740
Hello?

179
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:26,538
- Yes? - It's Bond.

180
00:43:26,578 --> 00:43:30,492
- I need her now. - I'm afraid she can't be disturbed. Can I take a message?

181
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:33,881
Listen, you go and find her, tell her to call security at Miami airport , -

182
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:36,864
- because I think that a bomb is about to go off. Can you do it now?

183
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:39,028
I can put you on hold.

184
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:46,341
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

185
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:50,872
I call you back.

186
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,770
- A Skyfleet S570 prototype. - What about it?

187
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:17,754
Largest airplane in the world, to be revieled today at Miami airport.

188
00:44:59,331 --> 00:45:00,889
Bond? Bond!

189
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:06,997
His target is the Skyfleet prototype. It's launching today.

190
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,913
I got to go.

191
00:52:04,066 --> 00:52:08,931
The poll's expired. I'm sorry, I'm not sure how much you've lost

192
00:52:08,961 --> 00:52:12,835
101.206.000 dollars.

193
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:07,408
Quite a body pile you're stacking up.

194
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:10,382
She was tortured first...

195
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:12,526
... as you already killed her husband, she must have been the only one left to question.

196
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:16,328
- Did she know anyhting compromising? - No.

197
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:19,322
- Your name, what you're after? - No.

198
00:53:20,222 --> 00:53:25,127
Dimitrios was the middle man, he knew how to put his hands on weapon, and people to use them.

199
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:27,120
Hw worked for anyone who had money.

200
00:53:27,322 --> 00:53:30,022
He was involved with a man called Le Chiffre, -

201
00:53:30,225 --> 00:53:32,783
- a private banker for the world's terrorists.

202
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:35,989
He invested their money and gave them access to it wherever they want it.

203
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,527
Og good, you're here.

204
00:53:38,225 --> 00:53:44,323
Albanian we believe, chess protegy, mathematical genious, likes to show it by playing poker.

205
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:17,526
- So you can keep an eye on me? - Yes.

206
00:54:22,533 --> 00:54:26,285
When they analyzed the stock market up to 9.11, -

207
00:54:26,315 --> 00:54:29,531
- the CIA discovered a massive shortage of airline stocks.

208
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:33,728
When the stock hit the bottom on 9.11, somebody made a fortune.

209
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:37,329
The same thing happened this morning with Skyfleet stock, or was supposed to.

210
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:41,526
With their prototype destroyed, the company would have been a bancrupcy.

211
00:54:41,728 --> 00:54:46,330
Instead, somebody lost over 100 million dollars betting the wrong way.

212
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:49,020
You think this man was Le Chiffre?

213
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:53,329
Which would explain how he could set up a high stakes poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

214
00:54:53,531 --> 00:54:57,536
10 players, $10 million buy in, $5 millioner re-buy

215
00:54:57,728 --> 00:55:00,338
Winner takes all, potentially $150 millions.

216
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,980
Good, then we know where he'll be. Do you want a clean kill or do you want to send a message?

217
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:09,582
We want him alive. Le Chiffre doesn't have a $100 million to loose.

218
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:13,425
He played the stock market with his client's funds?

219
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:15,832
They won't be too happy when they find out it's gone.

220
00:55:16,034 --> 00:55:19,928
We can't let him win this game. If he looses, he has nowhere to run.

221
00:55:19,938 --> 00:55:22,932
We'll give him sanfry in return for everything he knows.

222
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:27,321
I'm putting you in the game. Replacing someone playing for a syndicate.

223
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:30,335
According to Villiers, you are the best player in the Service.

224
00:55:31,336 --> 00:55:33,531
Thust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

225
00:55:37,536 --> 00:55:41,035
I would ask you if you could remain emotionally detached.

226
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:46,942
- But I know that's not your problem, is it Boond? - No.

227
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:53,930
Don't worry about keeping in touch. We know where you are.

228
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,036
You can stop pretending.  You knew I wouldn't let it stop, didn't you?

229
00:55:59,139 --> 00:56:01,141
When I knew you were you.

230
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:29,591
I am the money.

231
00:56:31,442 --> 00:56:33,444
Every penny of it.

232
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:38,046
The treasury has agreed to stake you in the game.

233
00:56:38,238 --> 00:56:42,344
Vesper. I hope your parent had it for that.

234
00:56:43,143 --> 00:56:45,085
Thank you.

235
00:56:45,095 --> 00:56:49,940
You must be well connected, I've never seen so much be done so quickly.

236
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,983
Or so stylishly.

237
00:56:53,338 --> 00:56:57,343
- May I ask you where it is? - $10 millions was wired to your account in Montenegro.

238
00:56:57,545 --> 00:57:01,702
With contuingency for 5 more, if I deem it a good looking investment.

239
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:05,131
I suppose you've given some thought to to the notion that if you loose, -

240
00:57:05,141 --> 00:57:09,469
- our government would have directly financed terrorism.

241
00:57:19,543 --> 00:57:22,546
So you're telling me it's a matter of probability?

242
00:57:22,749 --> 00:57:24,741
I was worried it was some chance involved.

243
00:57:24,943 --> 00:57:27,047
You'll never see the player with the best hand win.

244
00:57:27,745 --> 00:57:29,747
So that'll be what you call bluffing.

245
00:57:32,448 --> 00:57:34,450
You've heard the term?

246
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:38,546
Then you'll know that in poker you never play your hand, but the man a across from you.

247
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:41,388
- And you are good at reading people? - Yes, I am.

248
00:57:41,418 --> 00:57:45,413
Which is why I've noticed an undertone of sarcasm in your voice.

249
00:57:45,747 --> 00:57:48,144
-

250
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,343
- You don't think this is a very good plan, do you? - So there is a plan?

251
00:57:53,353 --> 00:57:58,541
I got the impression we were risking millions of dollars and houndreds of lives in a game of luck.

252
00:57:58,551 --> 00:58:02,152
- What else can you advice, mr. Bond? - About you, miss Lynd?

253
00:58:03,052 --> 00:58:04,943
Well, your beauty is a problem.

254
00:58:04,953 --> 00:58:07,512
You worry you're not being taken seriously.

255
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:10,344
Which is what you can say of any effective woman with a heart and brain.

256
00:58:10,354 --> 00:58:13,944
True, but this one overcompensates by wearing slugging masculine clothing -

257
00:58:13,954 --> 00:58:18,546
- and being more aggresive than her female collegues.

258
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:24,553
And ironically enough, and makses it less likely for her to be accepted and promoted by her male superiors, -

259
00:58:24,746 --> 00:58:27,739
- and mistake it a curtesy for arrogance.

260
00:58:27,749 --> 00:58:31,249
Now I'd normally go with "only child", but -

261
00:58:35,648 --> 00:58:37,752
- I would go for "Orphan".

262
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:42,657
All right.

263
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:46,642
By the cut of your suit you went to Oxford, -

264
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:50,748
- naturally thinking that human beings are dressed like that, but you worried it was demanded.

265
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:54,955
My guess is that you didn't come from money, and your school friends never let you forget it.

266
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:58,556
Which means that you were at that school by the grace of someone else's charity.

267
00:58:58,758 --> 00:59:04,452
And since you first thought of me being as an orphan, I would say that you are.

268
00:59:08,851 --> 00:59:12,654
And you are? I like this poker thing.

269
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,041
And that makes perfect sense, -

270
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:21,959
- since MI6 looks for an adjusted young man who gives little though to sacrificing others in order to protect queen and country.

271
00:59:22,555 --> 00:59:27,552
You know, former SAS types with easy smiles and expensive watches.

272
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:30,151
- Rolex? - Omega.

273
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:32,153
Beautiful.

274
00:59:32,558 --> 00:59:37,554
Now, after having first met you, I wouldn't go as far as calling you a cold hearted bastard.

275
00:59:37,756 --> 00:59:40,558
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine -

276
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:44,755
- that you think of women as disposable pleasures, rather feminine pursuits.

277
00:59:46,555 --> 00:59:51,157
So as charming as you are, mr. Bond, I will be keeping an eye of our government's money -

278
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,554
- and off of your perfectly formed ass.

279
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:57,549
- You noticed? - Even accountants have imagination.

280
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:02,454
- How was your lamb? - Stewed, my symphatys.

281
01:00:04,355 --> 01:00:08,411
- Good evening, mr. Bond. - Good evening, miss Lynd.

282
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:27,324
- Hotel Splendide, sir? - That's right.

283
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:30,064
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

284
01:00:43,718 --> 01:00:46,095
It's last minutes details.

285
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,604
Apparently, we're very much in love.

286
01:00:50,524 --> 01:00:54,985
- Do you usually leave it to the porter to tell you this sort of things? - Only when it's a necessary brief.

287
01:00:55,561 --> 01:00:59,222
I am mr. Arlington Beach, a professional gambler.

288
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,579
And you are miss Stephanie Broadchest...

289
01:01:01,862 --> 01:01:05,867
- You have to trust me on this. - You know I don't.

290
01:01:05,867 --> 01:01:09,993
We've been involved quite awhile, hence the shared suite.

291
01:01:10,196 --> 01:01:15,424
But my familiy is strict roman catholic, therefore for prudence's sake it will be a due two bedroom suite.

292
01:01:15,627 --> 01:01:19,136
I do hate it, when religion comes between us.

293
01:01:19,136 --> 01:01:21,139
Religion and a securely locked door.

294
01:01:21,675 --> 01:01:26,519
- Am I going to have a problem with you, Bond? - No, don't worry, you'rfe not my type.

295
01:01:26,691 --> 01:01:29,857
- Smart? - Single.

296
01:01:48,749 --> 01:01:53,553
- Welcome to the Hotel Splendide, what is your name, sir. - James Bond. You'll find the reservation under "Beach".

297
01:01:53,553 --> 01:01:58,600
- Welcome, mr. Bond. - You sign right there, you represent the treasury.

298
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:07,378
- Thank you, enjoy your stay. - I will.

299
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,476
Very funny.

300
01:02:12,506 --> 01:02:16,400
Look, Le Chiffre know I'm well connected, he also knows who I am and where the money is coming from.

301
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,412
Which means he has decided to play me anyway.

302
01:02:18,665 --> 01:02:22,771
He is either desperate or he is overly confident,  He is either desperate or overly self confident. But either way, that tells me something about him.

303
01:02:23,044 --> 01:02:25,907
And all he gets in return is a name that he already has.

304
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:30,903
You know he knows something about you. He knows you are reckless.

305
01:02:30,903 --> 01:02:35,130
Take the next one. It isn't room enough for me and your ego.

306
01:02:36,091 --> 01:02:39,914
- Mr. Bond, this is for you. - Thank you.

307
01:03:09,921 --> 01:03:11,924
I love you too, M.

308
01:03:49,668 --> 01:03:53,673
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis. I am your contact here.

309
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:01,845
- Does he know we have been watching him? - Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

310
01:04:02,563 --> 01:04:05,992
Probably because there is no "we". Just me.

311
01:04:07,398 --> 01:04:12,556
I'm afraid if you get into trouble here, recovery won't come over the next hill.

312
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,702
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday.

313
01:04:16,834 --> 01:04:19,999
I've spent the time reestablishing old relationships.

314
01:04:20,829 --> 01:04:23,124
The cief of police is here now, very close.

315
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:27,797
It is him, with the mustache, over my left shoulder.

316
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:32,652
- That can make life quite difficult. - And quite possible shorter.

317
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,937
He is not a very subtile man.

318
01:04:35,595 --> 01:04:37,880
I thought about buying his services, but -

319
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:41,986
- but quite franky, I couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

320
01:04:50,158 --> 01:04:55,165
I hate to say it, but the accountants seem to be running MI6 these days.

321
01:04:56,378 --> 01:04:59,412
Not that I have anything against accauntants.

322
01:04:59,412 --> 01:05:01,587
Many of them are lovely.

323
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:06,421
So I decided it was cheeper to supply his deputy with evidents -

324
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:09,931
- that we were bribing the chief.

325
01:05:09,931 --> 01:05:13,926
It's amazing what we can do with Photoshop these days, isn't it.

326
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,529
I think your odds are improving, mr Bond.

327
01:05:24,889 --> 01:05:28,884
- Yes? - For you.

328
01:05:29,541 --> 01:05:31,533
Something you expect med to wear?

329
01:05:34,406 --> 01:05:35,973
I need you to look fabulous, -

330
01:05:36,176 --> 01:05:42,800
- so when you walk up behind me and kiss me on my neck, the players will think about your neckline and not their cards.

331
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:44,833
Do you think you can do that for me?

332
01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:47,220
I'll do my best.

333
01:05:47,837 --> 01:05:49,839
Thank you.

334
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:06,092
- I have a dinner jacket. - There are dinner jackets and there are dinner jackets.

335
01:06:06,608 --> 01:06:10,623
This is the latter, and I need you looking like a man who belongs at that table.

336
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,929
How...

337
01:06:13,414 --> 01:06:17,510
- It is tailored. - I sliced you up when we met.

338
01:07:09,798 --> 01:07:13,793
- Good evening, sir. - Good evening.

339
01:07:14,046 --> 01:07:16,048
Thank you.

340
01:07:26,455 --> 01:07:30,460
Then you must be mr. Bliss' replacement. Welcome, mr. Beach.

341
01:07:31,826 --> 01:07:34,728
Or is that Bond? I am a little confused.

342
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:36,741
Oh, we wouldn't want that, would we?

343
01:07:40,463 --> 01:07:42,971
Monsieur Mendel. Please sit down.

344
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,695
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

345
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:53,601

346
01:07:53,601 --> 01:07:57,110
Monsieur Mendel represents the Basel banks in Switzerland holding the sticks.

347
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:02,308
Mesdames et messieurs. You have each deposited $10 millions buy in.

348
01:08:02,308 --> 01:08:05,403
Further buy in of $5 million can be made by electronic transfer.

349
01:08:05,403 --> 01:08:11,461
The money will remain in ascrow until the winner enters his password into the encrypter.

350
01:08:11,704 --> 01:08:16,205
Whereupon the entire sum will be wired to any bank account in the world you nominate.

351
01:08:16,397 --> 01:08:18,389
Mr. Bond?

352
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:22,404
We proceed alphabetically. Please be so kind as to enter a password of your choice.

353
01:08:30,202 --> 01:08:32,205
Six letters or more.

354
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:46,030
High card from dealer position.

355
01:08:53,605 --> 01:08:58,096
Monsieur Gallardo, mr. Kaminoksky has a small blind for $5000, -

356
01:08:58,126 --> 01:09:01,221
- and mr. Fukutu the big blind for $10.000.

357
01:09:04,204 --> 01:09:06,207
Enjoy the game.

358
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:30,611
Four players.

359
01:09:31,805 --> 01:09:33,807
Your bet?

360
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:37,256
Check. Check.

361
01:09:42,505 --> 01:09:44,457
Bet $50.000.

362
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:59,213
Call.

363
01:10:02,136 --> 01:10:04,057
Fold.

364
01:10:05,109 --> 01:10:07,111
Fold. Heads-up.

365
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,412
Monsieur Le Chiffre?

366
01:10:24,113 --> 01:10:26,115
Bet $100.000.

367
01:10:29,614 --> 01:10:34,813
- You were supposed to enter so the others could see you. - Was I? Forgive me.

368
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,312
Good luck darling.

369
01:10:42,115 --> 01:10:44,118
It's up to you, monsieur Bond.

370
01:10:46,110 --> 01:10:50,115
- Monsieur Bond? - Excuse me, what was the bet? $100.000?

371
01:10:50,914 --> 01:10:52,916
Call.

372
01:10:59,015 --> 01:11:02,605
I suppose I don't have to tell you how beautiful you look?

373
01:11:02,615 --> 01:11:05,619
Half the people at that table are still watching you.

374
01:11:05,822 --> 01:11:07,814
Champagne.

375
01:11:10,615 --> 01:11:12,618
Monsieur Le Chiffre?

376
01:11:22,823 --> 01:11:24,815
Bet $200.000.

377
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:33,523
Monsieur, you have been called. Show your cards please.

378
01:11:35,616 --> 01:11:38,924
Full house to monsieur Le Chiffre. 9's over 2's.

379
01:11:39,116 --> 01:11:41,118
Mr. Bond?

380
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,417
Fold.

381
01:11:51,819 --> 01:11:53,821
Send the barman over, please.

382
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,420
Dry Martini. Wait.

383
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,620
Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of China Lillet. Shake up, add some ice and a thin slice of lemon.

384
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:13,816
- Yes, sir. - Bruno, I'll have one of those.

385
01:12:13,826 --> 01:12:16,719
- So will I. - Certainly.

386
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:20,622
Fred, bring me one as well, and keep the fruit.

387
01:12:22,322 --> 01:12:24,324
That's it?

388
01:12:25,153 --> 01:12:28,703
- Anyone wants play poker now? - One's in a hurry.

389
01:12:36,622 --> 01:12:38,625
Will you excuse me.

390
01:12:51,530 --> 01:12:54,716
- Taste nice - I thought we dispenced the covers.

391
01:12:54,726 --> 01:12:59,530
No, we dispenced with one that was of no use and created another that is.

392
01:13:00,025 --> 01:13:02,028
- Is he watching? - Yes.

393
01:13:02,422 --> 01:13:07,429
This is mean character, pissed off because you're loosing so fast we won't be here past midnight.

394
01:13:07,631 --> 01:13:11,626
I'll bring my character's feelings mirror my own.

395
01:13:13,244 --> 01:13:17,249
You know that's not half bad. I must come up with a name for that.

396
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:21,042
He was worth it. To discover his talent.

397
01:13:21,628 --> 01:13:25,249
- What do you mean? - The twich he has to hide when he bluffs.

398
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:29,143
- Bluffs? He had the best hand. - Which he got on the last card.

399
01:13:29,143 --> 01:13:31,631
The odds against was 23 to 1 and he knew that.

400
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,825
When he did his first raise he had nothing.

401
01:13:34,028 --> 01:13:36,425
Then it was blind luck. You got the bug?

402
01:13:36,627 --> 01:13:38,629
Yes.

403
01:13:39,226 --> 01:13:41,229
Thank you.

404
01:13:44,232 --> 01:13:46,427
Maybe he can fix his deposit half.

405
01:13:55,428 --> 01:13:59,636
Ladies and gentlemen. Mesdames et messieurs. We have now been playing for 4 hours.

406
01:13:59,828 --> 01:14:03,833
It's time for a short break. We will resume play in one hour.

407
01:14:32,323 --> 01:14:36,702
Well, I think I will report about the evenings "florentines".

408
01:14:41,334 --> 01:14:43,337
- Sir. - You wanted to do what to me?

409
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:47,635
- You've lost me completely. - You said you couldn't wait to have me back in the room. Come on.

410
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:13,142
So what's so damned important?

411
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:18,634
I'm so..

412
01:15:21,334 --> 01:15:23,336
Where is my money?

413
01:15:26,937 --> 01:15:29,941
- Good evening. - You're holding a parcel for me?

414
01:15:34,745 --> 01:15:36,737
Thank you.

415
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,845
You think you can loose that kind of money and no one will notice?

416
01:15:42,745 --> 01:15:44,737
You money is safe.

417
01:15:45,839 --> 01:15:47,842
Open that.

418
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:07,341
You'll have it tomorrow. All of it.

419
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:24,646
I will take a hand for this treason, but you need to use yours.

420
01:16:28,843 --> 01:16:30,845
Hold out your arm.

421
01:16:31,847 --> 01:16:33,849
Hold out your arm, my beaty.

422
01:16:34,142 --> 01:16:36,145
Or I'll take your head.

423
01:16:45,247 --> 01:16:47,351
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

424
01:17:00,802 --> 01:17:02,795
Stairs.

425
01:17:06,344 --> 01:17:08,347
Not a world of protest.

426
01:17:09,348 --> 01:17:11,553
Should find a new boyfriend.

427
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:15,163
Go find Mathis, tell him I've hidden the bodies down here, and I want him to get rid of them.

428
01:19:15,658 --> 01:19:17,661
Do that now. Go. Go!

429
01:20:19,668 --> 01:20:21,660
You've changed your shirt, mr. Bond.

430
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:25,170
I hope our game doesn't make you transpire?

431
01:20:26,262 --> 01:20:31,460
A little, but I don't consider myself in trouble until I start wheeping blood.

432
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:34,666
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's ready, let's continue the game.

433
01:21:34,772 --> 01:21:37,776
The blood on my hands are not coming off.

434
01:21:39,768 --> 01:21:41,771
May I see.

435
01:21:56,668 --> 01:21:58,671
That's better?

436
01:22:02,474 --> 01:22:04,870
- Cold? - Yes.

437
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:06,675
- Any trouble with the bodies? - Not at all.

438
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:23,980
Being dead doesn't mean one still can't be helpful.

439
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,876
Le Chiffre will keep looking over his shoulder, wondering who it will come from next.

440
01:23:31,484 --> 01:23:33,477
How is our girl?

441
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:36,683
Melted your cold heart?

442
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:57,679
- Fold. - Fold.

443
01:23:57,891 --> 01:24:00,076
And fold.

444
01:24:01,097 --> 01:24:02,907
Three players.

445
01:24:05,284 --> 01:24:08,500
- Monsieur? - 300 grand.

446
01:24:08,531 --> 01:24:10,533
Bet, $300.000.

447
01:24:11,919 --> 01:24:13,911
Call.

448
01:24:15,388 --> 01:24:17,390
And call.

449
01:24:21,092 --> 01:24:23,327
Three players.

450
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,647
Check.

451
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:34,482
Monsieur Bond?

452
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:45,385
Bet $500.000.

453
01:24:58,492 --> 01:25:00,485
Look, its the tank, he's bluffing.

454
01:25:01,385 --> 01:25:03,387
My God, James was right.

455
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,492
It's up to you.

456
01:25:12,389 --> 01:25:14,391
Raise, $1 million.

457
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,888
Seem someone know something I don't.

458
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:27,296
Fold. Heads-up, gentlemen.

459
01:25:27,943 --> 01:25:29,946
It's up to you.

460
01:25:43,094 --> 01:25:45,096
Two.

461
01:25:45,491 --> 01:25:47,493
Will raise, $2 million.

462
01:25:49,496 --> 01:25:51,498
It's up to you.

463
01:26:02,097 --> 01:26:04,090
I'm all in.

464
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,195
Well it's $14,5 millioner. It is up to you, monsieur Bond.

465
01:26:18,593 --> 01:26:22,598
Bond will have to call all in to call his bluff.

466
01:26:23,599 --> 01:26:25,591
- Call. - Call.

467
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:28,444
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

468
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:32,894
Full house, kings and aces.

469
01:26:33,197 --> 01:26:35,199
Monsieur Le Chiffre?

470
01:26:47,852 --> 01:26:51,847
It's four checks. Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

471
01:26:55,103 --> 01:26:57,804
You thought I was bluffing, mr. Bond.

472
01:27:00,544 --> 01:27:02,547
Please, we now break for one hour.

473
01:27:02,597 --> 01:27:06,603
When we return, big blind will be $200.000.

474
01:27:41,899 --> 01:27:45,894
I'm gonna need the other $5 million to buy me back in.

475
01:27:45,904 --> 01:27:47,907
I can't do that, James.

476
01:27:48,605 --> 01:27:50,607
Look, I made a mistake.

477
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:54,703
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant, but I can beat him.

478
01:27:54,906 --> 01:27:58,698
- I'm sorry - Sorry? Sorry?

479
01:27:58,708 --> 01:28:01,904
Why aren't you putting that in a sentence, like maybe, "sorry that Le Chiffre wins, -

480
01:28:02,106 --> 01:28:04,908
- continuing terrorism and killing innocent people."

481
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:09,206
You lost because of your ego. And your ego can't take it.

482
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:13,110
- All you're going to do now is loose more. - Well then you're an idiot.

483
01:28:13,302 --> 01:28:17,307
- I'm sorry? - I said you're a bloody idiot.

484
01:28:18,005 --> 01:28:20,008
Look in my eyes.

485
01:28:20,857 --> 01:28:22,860
I can beat this man. You know that.

486
01:28:25,054 --> 01:28:26,855
Put your hand off my arm.

487
01:28:49,813 --> 01:28:52,291
- Vodka Martini. - Shaken or stirred?

488
01:28:52,321 --> 01:28:54,324
Do I look like I give a damn?

489
01:29:11,557 --> 01:29:13,560
- James, get the girl.

490
01:29:22,409 --> 01:29:25,716
Sorry, I should introduce myself since we seem related.

491
01:29:25,909 --> 01:29:28,710
Felix Leiter. A brother from Langley.

492
01:29:30,713 --> 01:29:34,718
You shall have a little faith. You keep your head above you, I think you have him.

493
01:29:34,738 --> 01:29:36,710
Had. Excuse me.

494
01:29:37,509 --> 01:29:41,908
- You're not buying in? - No.

495
01:29:45,711 --> 01:29:49,504
Listen, I'm bleeding chips. I'm not gonna last much longer.

496
01:29:49,514 --> 01:29:51,719
You have a better chance, I'll stake you.

497
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:55,511
I'm saying I'll give you the money to keep going.

498
01:29:55,714 --> 01:29:59,719
Just one thing. If it bought off, the CIA brings him in.

499
01:30:01,711 --> 01:30:03,714
And what about the winnings?

500
01:30:04,513 --> 01:30:06,717
Does it look like we need the money?

501
01:30:18,217 --> 01:30:20,219
Shall we up the blinds?

502
01:30:22,121 --> 01:30:24,113
Why not.

503
01:30:27,218 --> 01:30:29,220
Bet.

504
01:30:30,515 --> 01:30:32,517
Rise.

505
01:30:51,723 --> 01:30:53,716
Excuse me.

506
01:30:58,631 --> 01:31:02,474
- Call. - Rise $500.000.

507
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:07,956
- Fold. - Thank you.

508
01:31:09,968 --> 01:31:11,971
Fold.

509
01:31:14,914 --> 01:31:16,917
Fold.

510
01:31:44,021 --> 01:31:48,491
- Give me. - Sorry sir, you are big blind.

511
01:32:54,979 --> 01:32:57,285
- Who is it? - 007.

512
01:32:58,802 --> 01:33:02,797
Bond's being poisened. He's going into a cardiac arrest.

513
01:33:03,758 --> 01:33:08,420
Stay calm, don't interrupt, you will be dead within two minutes uness you do exactly like I tell you.

514
01:33:08,997 --> 01:33:12,506
- I'm all ears. - Remove the defillibrator from the couch.

515
01:33:12,506 --> 01:33:16,005
- Do we know what it is yet? - We're still scanning.

516
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:21,689
Attach the leads to your chest.

517
01:33:30,731 --> 01:33:34,736
Ventricular takykardi - digitalis. What did they give him?

518
01:33:38,407 --> 01:33:41,735
- As soon as it reads charged ... the button ... - Don't push the red button!

519
01:33:41,937 --> 01:33:44,435
- You hear me, don't push it yet. - His heart's gonna stop.

520
01:33:44,637 --> 01:33:47,732
There is time for only one charge.

521
01:33:47,934 --> 01:33:51,423
Take the blue combi pen, Bond. Mid neck. Into the vein.

522
01:33:57,239 --> 01:34:02,073
You will pass out in a few seconds, push the red button now, Bond!

523
01:34:07,737 --> 01:34:11,742
- Bond, push the red button. - Do it now!

524
01:34:56,738 --> 01:35:00,743
- You ok? - Me?

525
01:35:01,744 --> 01:35:06,143
- Thank you. - You're welcome. Take a trip to the hospital.

526
01:35:06,346 --> 01:35:08,338
I'll do.

527
01:35:09,137 --> 01:35:13,142
- Soon as I've won this game - You're not seriously going back there.

528
01:35:15,741 --> 01:35:17,744
I wouldn't dream of it.

529
01:35:19,241 --> 01:35:21,243
Bet $1 million.

530
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:28,141
- All in. - Gentllemen, showdown please.

531
01:35:30,366 --> 01:35:32,399
To pair. Aces and sevens

532
01:35:35,949 --> 01:35:37,941
Queen plays. Wins.

533
01:35:46,871 --> 01:35:50,785
I'm sorry,  The last hand almost killed me.

534
01:35:52,161 --> 01:35:57,137
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange we enter the final phase of the game. There's no more buyings.

535
01:35:57,845 --> 01:35:59,918
The big blind is now $1 million dollars.

536
01:36:07,443 --> 01:36:09,445
Four players.

537
01:36:11,144 --> 01:36:13,147
It's your bet.

538
01:36:16,545 --> 01:36:18,547
- Monsieur Bond? - Check.

539
01:36:19,144 --> 01:36:21,703
$24 million in the pot already.

540
01:36:24,848 --> 01:36:28,429
- Check. - Check. All check.

541
01:36:29,187 --> 01:36:31,392
Four players.

542
01:36:35,296 --> 01:36:37,298
- Check. - Check.

543
01:36:42,001 --> 01:36:44,004
All in. $6 million.

544
01:36:44,934 --> 01:36:47,463
Bet. $6 millioner. All in.

545
01:36:52,732 --> 01:36:54,734
$5 million. All in.

546
01:36:55,149 --> 01:36:57,151
Bid is $6 million.

547
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:06,658
Rise.

548
01:37:07,821 --> 01:37:10,097
Rise $12 million.

549
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:12,352
Heads-up.

01:37:41,935 --> 01:37:44,150

551
01:37:47,103 --> 01:37:49,105
Rise. All in.

552
01:38:07,523 --> 01:38:10,041
Well, I think I will call your lepard.

553
01:38:17,828 --> 01:38:19,325
Call.

554
01:38:30,177 --> 01:38:33,050
$150 millioner in the pot.

555
01:38:34,263 --> 01:38:36,165
Gentlemen, showdown please.

556
01:38:40,544 --> 01:38:42,809

Higher full house..

01:39:13,545 --> 01:39:15,254
Aces and six'es.

560
01:39:20,857 --> 01:39:22,849

01:39:41,307 --> 01:39:44,007
Straight Flush. 4 till 8.

563
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:46,222
A high hand.

564
01:39:50,965 --> 01:39:52,230
Monsieur Bond wins.

565
01:39:53,241 --> 01:39:56,740
- Please. - Thank you very much.

566
01:39:59,329 --> 01:40:03,324
- He is all yours. - I appreciate it, brother.

567
01:40:09,534 --> 01:40:10,819
Congratulations.

568
01:40:10,819 --> 01:40:14,814
- You know it is no celebration in it. - You were almost dead an hour ago.

569
01:40:16,209 --> 01:40:18,212
Come on, I'm finished.

570
01:40:38,186 --> 01:40:42,343
Mathis says the americans have contacted Le Chiffre.

571
01:40:42,343 --> 01:40:44,437
They think to extract him before dawn.

572
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:47,744
You know, I think I would call that a Vesper.

573
01:40:48,826 --> 01:40:51,961
- Is it the after taste? - No.

574
01:40:51,971 --> 01:40:55,976
Because once you have tasted it, that's all you want to cook.

575
01:40:57,503 --> 01:41:01,630
- That was quite a good line. - That's a very good line.

576
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:04,775
- But you're laughing at it. - Not so much because of you.

577
01:41:04,977 --> 01:41:06,970
Well, that's fine.

578
01:41:13,473 --> 01:41:15,678
I'll figure out what that is.

579
01:41:17,559 --> 01:41:21,109
- It's an algerian love knot. - Really?

580
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:24,173
- I thought it was just pretty. - No.

581
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,571
Someone gave it to you.

582
01:41:30,747 --> 01:41:32,750
He is a very lucky man.

583
01:41:38,555 --> 01:41:41,114
You can switch off so easily, can't you?

584
01:41:41,549 --> 01:41:43,915
Doesn't bother you killing these people?

585
01:41:44,259 --> 01:41:48,042
I wouldn't be much if I did.

586
01:41:48,234 --> 01:41:50,236
I don't believe you.

587
01:41:51,015 --> 01:41:53,018
You got a choice you know.

588
01:41:53,412 --> 01:41:57,002
Just because you've done something, doesn't mean you keep doing it.

589
01:41:57,194 --> 01:42:00,562
Why is it people who can't take advice also insist giving it?

590
01:42:00,562 --> 01:42:03,505
Are you thinking I don't take my own advice?

591
01:42:03,536 --> 01:42:05,538
I think something is driving you.

592
01:42:06,155 --> 01:42:10,160
And I think I'll never find out what it is.

593
01:42:14,014 --> 01:42:16,006
Mathis needs me.

594
01:42:16,775 --> 01:42:19,576
Good night. Congratulations again.

595
01:42:37,983 --> 01:42:39,176
Mathis.

596
01:44:28,688 --> 01:44:35,069
I'm afraid your friend Mathis, is really ... my friend.

597
01:46:13,051 --> 01:46:14,790
Bond ...

598
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:16,985
You've taken good care about your body.

599
01:46:24,146 --> 01:46:26,148
Such a vaste.

600
01:46:43,159 --> 01:46:47,903
You know, I've never understood these levelled tortures.

601
01:46:48,509 --> 01:46:50,694
It's the simplest things -

602
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:53,900
-to cause more pain than a man can possibly enjoy.

603
01:46:56,105 --> 01:47:02,305
And of course, it's not only the immediate pain, but the knowledge that if you don't give up quickly enough-

604
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:07,200
- there will be not much left to define you as a man.

605
01:47:13,005 --> 01:47:15,007
The only question remains...

606
01:47:16,282 --> 01:47:18,284
Will you give up in time?

607
01:47:20,307 --> 01:47:22,309
I want the money.

608
01:47:41,212 --> 01:47:45,379
Miss Lynd will give me the account number, if she has not already.

609
01:47:45,379 --> 01:47:47,624
So all I need from you is the password.

610
01:47:56,939 --> 01:47:59,012
The password.. please.

611
01:48:04,210 --> 01:48:07,214
I've gotten an itch.. down there.

612
01:48:08,883 --> 01:48:10,875
Would you mind?

613
01:48:18,208 --> 01:48:20,706
No! No!

614
01:48:23,244 --> 01:48:25,651
To the right, to the right, to the right.

615
01:48:26,107 --> 01:48:28,109
You are a funny man, mr. Bond.

616
01:48:32,964 --> 01:48:35,351
Yes, yes, yes!

617
01:48:41,712 --> 01:48:45,909
Now the whole world's gonna know that you died while scratching my balls.

618
01:48:48,316 --> 01:48:51,017
I died? I died ...?

619
01:48:51,209 --> 01:48:54,900
Yes, because no matter what you do, I'm not gonna give you the password -

620
01:48:54,910 --> 01:48:59,613
- which means that your clients will hunt you down and cut you in little pieces of meat while you're still breathing.

621
01:48:59,987 --> 01:49:03,608
Because if you kill me, there will be nowhere else to hide.

622
01:49:03,618 --> 01:49:05,712
But you are so wrong!

623
01:49:06,572 --> 01:49:09,019
Because after I've slaughted you and your little girlfriend-

624
01:49:09,211 --> 01:49:12,114
- your people will still welcome me with open arms.

625
01:49:28,184 --> 01:49:30,187
Give me the password.

626
01:49:30,622 --> 01:49:32,624
And I will at least let her live.

627
01:49:36,690 --> 01:49:40,685
Do it soon enough, she will still be in one peace.

628
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:55,320
- You really arn't going to tell me? - No.

629
01:49:57,797 --> 01:49:59,800
So I think ... -

630
01:50:03,815 --> 01:50:07,820
- I will feed you with what you have undone.

631
01:50:19,795 --> 01:50:21,787
I'll get the money.

632
01:50:22,788 --> 01:50:24,791
Tell them, I'll get the money.

633
01:50:25,418 --> 01:50:29,221
Money isn't as valuable to our organisation as the ability to trust.

634
01:51:34,626 --> 01:51:36,628
Any ideas?

635
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:42,727
- What? - Why he left the two of you alive.

636
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:46,833
Where is she?

637
01:51:47,228 --> 01:51:49,230
Sleeping.

638
01:51:49,796 --> 01:51:52,416
And I'm supposed to make you drink this.

639
01:51:53,721 --> 01:51:55,723
It's just odd.

640
01:51:56,006 --> 01:51:58,868
Killing all, but leaving you and her untouched.

641
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:03,946
Almost like someone tried to tell us something.

642
01:52:03,946 --> 01:52:05,948
Did you look at the killer?

643
01:52:06,757 --> 01:52:08,760
No.

644
01:52:09,538 --> 01:52:11,541
Shame.

645
01:52:12,856 --> 01:52:14,848
Drink up.

646
01:52:17,832 --> 01:52:20,036
Anything else you remember?

647
01:52:20,330 --> 01:52:24,021
- Anything else that can help us? - Help us?

648
01:52:24,031 --> 01:52:26,034
Or help you?

649
01:53:05,578 --> 01:53:07,723
- Hello. - Hello.

650
01:53:10,140 --> 01:53:11,990
You're all right?

651
01:53:12,021 --> 01:53:14,782
I came just to waking you.

652
01:53:14,812 --> 01:53:18,817
You're always looking at me like you haven't seen me in years.

653
01:53:19,839 --> 01:53:21,841
Makes me feel reborn.

654
01:53:25,836 --> 01:53:27,839
If you've just been born -

655
01:53:29,164 --> 01:53:31,166
- would you be naked?

656
01:53:32,208 --> 01:53:34,210
You have me there.

657
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,842
You can have me anyway.

658
01:53:41,189 --> 01:53:42,382
I can?

659
01:53:43,414 --> 01:53:45,932
Yes, here, there, any way you like.

660
01:53:47,965 --> 01:53:53,032
- Does this mean that you will make love to me? - Yes, that's how I would describe it.

661
01:53:53,234 --> 01:53:57,977
Not long ago, if you described your feeling about me not long ago..

662
01:53:59,444 --> 01:54:03,146
..I'm trying to find a better word than "nobody".

663
01:54:03,156 --> 01:54:05,158
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

664
01:54:06,493 --> 01:54:08,506
That's something to be afraid of.

665
01:54:11,044 --> 01:54:13,037
Hello.

666
01:54:13,441 --> 01:54:15,444
Perfect timing.

667
01:54:16,587 --> 01:54:19,530
Mr. Mendel, how are things in Switzerland?

668
01:54:19,540 --> 01:54:23,646
My apologies. I do not mean to rush, but a $120 million is a large sum of money.

669
01:54:23,838 --> 01:54:26,437
It certainly is. You didn't bring anyt chocolate with you?

670
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:28,642
I'm afraid not.

671
01:54:29,856 --> 01:54:32,445
If you would type in the account number,

672
01:54:39,575 --> 01:54:43,661
- And then the password - You can do that.

673
01:54:43,691 --> 01:54:45,694
I would if I knew what it was.

674
01:54:45,846 --> 01:54:51,843
V ... E ... S ... P ... E ... R.

675
01:55:02,746 --> 01:55:06,751
The account has been transferred. Sorry to disturbing you.

676
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:11,150
- Auf wiedersehen. - Auf wiedersehen.

677
01:55:17,643 --> 01:55:19,646
You know, James?

678
01:55:20,829 --> 01:55:24,733
I just want you to know that if all that was left of you... -

679
01:55:24,743 --> 01:55:27,838
- was your smile and your little finger ...

680
01:55:27,848 --> 01:55:31,853
you would be more of a man than anyone else.

681
01:55:39,468 --> 01:55:43,473
That's because you know what I can do with my little finger.

682
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:49,845
- I have no idea. - But you're aching to find out..

683
01:55:53,021 --> 01:55:55,438
You're not going to let me in there?

684
01:55:57,228 --> 01:55:59,231
You got your armor back on.

685
01:56:02,244 --> 01:56:04,237
I have no armor left.

686
01:56:05,875 --> 01:56:07,868
You stripped it from me.

687
01:56:09,223 --> 01:56:11,225
What there is left of me.

688
01:56:12,136 --> 01:56:14,128
Whatever is left of me..

689
01:56:15,514 --> 01:56:17,516
Whatever I am..

690
01:56:17,900 --> 01:56:19,903
I'm yours.

691
01:57:19,857 --> 01:57:22,153
M won't miss me for a couple of days.

692
01:57:23,498 --> 01:57:26,370
- She'll be too busy sweating Mathis. - Mathis?

693
01:57:26,370 --> 01:57:30,952
Remember, what I told you about Le Chiffre, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

694
01:57:31,902 --> 01:57:33,146
That's how he won me out.

695
01:57:33,349 --> 01:57:37,354
The same goes for the implant, I'm not going to miss that.

696
01:57:37,384 --> 01:57:40,863
- I can't believe that. - Neither could I.

697
01:57:41,692 --> 01:57:43,685
I thougth he hid my back.

698
01:57:44,666 --> 01:57:46,668
But there you go.

699
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:49,854
Does everyone have a toll?

700
01:57:51,715 --> 01:57:53,708
Yes.

701
01:57:56,266 --> 01:57:58,269
Yes, everyone.

702
01:57:58,461 --> 01:58:00,463
Everyone except you.

703
01:58:04,651 --> 01:58:06,865
That's why I love you.

704
01:58:08,676 --> 01:58:10,668
Do you love me?

705
01:58:10,860 --> 01:58:16,059
Enough to float around the world with you, until one of us must find an honest job.

706
01:58:16,463 --> 01:58:20,458
But I think that's gonna be you, because I have no idea what an honest job is.

707
01:58:21,075 --> 01:58:23,078
Are you serious?

708
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:24,504
Like you said ...

709
01:58:25,778 --> 01:58:29,773
If you do what I do for too long, then there'll not be any soul left to salvage.

710
01:58:30,481 --> 01:58:34,486
I'm leaving with all that I have left.

711
01:58:35,265 --> 01:58:36,762
Is that enough for you?

712
02:00:20,184 --> 02:00:23,400
No stop, I've gotta go to the bank.

713
02:00:24,078 --> 02:00:25,271
What's the time?

714
02:00:27,871 --> 02:00:30,672
How much do you think we need to float for a month?

715
02:00:30,874 --> 02:00:33,089
I got plenty.

716
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:35,972
I want to pay for my half.

717
02:00:39,471 --> 02:00:41,474
You stopped wearing your necklace.

718
02:00:41,878 --> 02:00:43,931
Yes. It was time.

719
02:00:45,104 --> 02:00:47,107
Time enough to look after the soul?

720
02:00:52,315 --> 02:00:54,864
You realize that one cannot always forget the past.

721
02:01:03,875 --> 02:01:06,080
Apparently not for your employer.

722
02:01:10,378 --> 02:01:12,381
Back in one month.

723
02:01:14,576 --> 02:01:18,581
Come on, I get money, you get supplies.

724
02:01:47,789 --> 02:01:49,792
Be back here in half an hour.

725
02:02:13,437 --> 02:02:16,876
- Hello, M. - I got your note.

726
02:02:16,906 --> 02:02:20,477
- Yes? - We'll talk about that later.

727
02:02:20,487 --> 02:02:23,035
Right now I have a man from treasury here.

728
02:02:23,238 --> 02:02:27,232
He wonders if you ever is going to deposit the winnings.

729
02:02:28,891 --> 02:02:32,158
That's a shame, I didn't think they'd miss it.

730
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:35,546
Yes. I told them not to worry.

731
02:02:35,839 --> 02:02:39,834
- So you'll deposit today? - I'm on my way to the bank right now.

732
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:43,202
James Bond for mr. Mendel.

733
02:02:45,437 --> 02:02:49,098
Mr Mendel, I have some trouble accessing the funds of my account.

734
02:02:49,098 --> 02:02:53,093
It was transferred to the bank account number your company gave us, mr Bond.

735
02:02:55,945 --> 02:02:58,443
It appears the money is being drawn as we speak.

736
02:03:01,285 --> 02:03:02,489
Where?

737
02:03:02,691 --> 02:03:05,877
The Venece branch of course, at St. Mark's Square.

738
02:03:05,887 --> 02:03:09,892
Is there a problem, mr. Bond?

739
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:21,795
- I'll kill her! - Allow me.

740
02:09:32,888 --> 02:09:34,890
I'm sorry, James.

741
02:12:40,739 --> 02:12:42,934
She had a boy friend, a French Algerian.

742
02:12:43,672 --> 02:12:45,665
They were vey much in love.

743
02:12:46,039 --> 02:12:49,023
He was kidnapped by the organisation behind Le Chiffre.

744
02:12:49,023 --> 02:12:53,746
And they blackmailed her and wanted to kill him, unless she cooperated.

745
02:12:54,261 --> 02:12:59,935
We should have picked up on it, but sometimes we're so focused on our enemies, we forget to watch our friends.

746
02:13:01,240 --> 02:13:03,242
How are you doing?

747
02:13:03,344 --> 02:13:05,730
She left her cell phone.

748
02:13:05,741 --> 02:13:07,743
She must have known I'd check it.

749
02:13:08,805 --> 02:13:10,797
She knew you were you.

750
02:13:11,637 --> 02:13:14,519
- Well, at least this clears Mathis. - No.

751
02:13:14,550 --> 02:13:18,544
- No? - No, it just proves that he's guilty, not innocent.

752
02:13:18,737 --> 02:13:20,941
Could be a double blind.

753
02:13:21,842 --> 02:13:25,634
- You don't trust anyone, do you, James? - No.

754
02:13:25,644 --> 02:13:27,637
Then you've learned your lesson.

755
02:13:28,284 --> 02:13:31,591
Come back as soon as you can, we need you.

756
02:13:31,591 --> 02:13:33,594
Will do.

757
02:13:34,089 --> 02:13:37,943
- If you do need time ... - Why should I need more time?

758
02:13:38,782 --> 02:13:40,633
Job's done.

759
02:13:40,643 --> 02:13:43,121
The bitch is dead.

760
02:13:43,161 --> 02:13:45,103
James?

761
02:13:45,143 --> 02:13:49,138
Did you ever asked yourself, why you weren't killed that night?

762
02:13:49,169 --> 02:13:54,408
Isn't that obvious? She made a deal to spare your life in exchange for the money.

763
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:58,534
She hoped they would let her live.

764
02:13:58,544 --> 02:14:01,781
But she must have known, she had to have her death.

765
02:14:01,811 --> 02:14:06,018
And now we'll never know who was behind this.

766
02:14:06,059 --> 02:14:08,051
The trail's gone cold.

767
02:15:32,510 --> 02:15:36,273
- Hello? - Mr. White? We need to talk.

768
02:15:36,536 --> 02:15:38,528
Who is this?

769
02:16:07,959 --> 02:16:10,852
The name is Bond. James Bond.
